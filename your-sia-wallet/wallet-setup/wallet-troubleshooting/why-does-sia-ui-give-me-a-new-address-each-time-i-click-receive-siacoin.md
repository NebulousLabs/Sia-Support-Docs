# Why does Sia-UI give me a new address each time I click Receive Siacoin?

Address reuse is a security and privacy issue in the crypto space, affecting any blockchain project that uses addresses. You can read more about it [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse). In short, with a combination of address reuse and social engineering, a malicious party could identify you and how much cryptocurrency you hold.

## How it relates to your Siacoin wallet

When it comes to your Siacoin addresses, we try to avoid address reuse whenever possible. The Sia network is a blockchain project just like Bitcoin, and – in a worst-case scenario – your privacy could be compromised with address reuse. **Sia-UI will create a new receiving address whenever you click**`Generate New Address`**.** This is intentional.

## What about those old addresses I made?

Your old addresses still work! Every address generated by Sia will always link to your wallet. You can re-use previous addresses if your risk tolerance is higher than the risk created by doing it.

## How risky is it, really?

It can vary, and you should learn more about address reuse before making a decision. But most people seriously involved in the crypto space will tell you to err on the side of caution, and re-use addresses as little as possible.

## How do I find my old addresses?

To find a list of all addresses linked to your wallet, go to the Terminal tab and type:

`wallet addresses`
