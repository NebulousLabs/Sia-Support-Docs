Before Sia-UI launches, you'll likely see a warning that the app is from an unknown publisher. This is standard whenever you try to open an app that is not on your OS developer's approved list. In this case, Sia-UI is from Nebulous, the company the employs the Sia development team. Click **Run.**

Your computer is going to double-check with you about installing Sia-UI. If you see: `Do you want to allow this app form an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?`, click **Yes.**

Depending on your installed security software, you may also see a warning regarding network access or some other security precaution. In this example, Windows Defender is asking if siad.exe, the primary file that Sia uses to operate, is allowed to communicate on the network. Click **Allow access.**

As of macOS 10.15 Catalina, you may be notified that Sia-UI may contain malicious software. **Sia-UI is safe to use**, but since it hasn't been pre-verified with Apple they give a warning to be extra safe. To install, either go to System Preferences > Security and Privacy, and click Allow, or right-click the app icon and choose Open.

We need to tell your Mac that Sia-UI is safe to run. Navigate to System Preferences, which can be accessed by clicking on the Apple in the upper left corner of your screen. Once there, click on **Security and Privacy.** This is in the first row of icons.
