# My public IP address is dynamic, and my Sia host goes Offline when it changes.

You can use a free Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service. DDNS involves registering for and receiving your own address, like "mysiahost.ddns.net", in combination with running a small program or script on your computer. Some routers also have built-in DDNS support for certain providers. When your public IP address changes, the DDNS program detects the change and configures your DDNS address with the new IP. This way, you can announce your Sia host using your DDNS address, and it should stay Online even with public IP changes.

There are a number of free DDNS providers which can be found by searching for DDNS using your favorite search engine. One popular free option is [NoIP.com](https://www.noip.com).
