# Why are there multiple small deductions taken from my wallet?

If you don't use DDNS, you probably have a dynamic IP from your ISP that changes from time to time. When this happens, your Sia host re-announces itself and this becomes a transaction in your wallet.

You also might see multiple transactions form as collateral gets tied up in contracts. This is totally normal.
