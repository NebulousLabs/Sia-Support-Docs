# How do I shut my Sia host down?

You can stop accepting new contracts by turning off the green slider next to "Announce Host" in the Host tab. However, this only stops new contracts - you still need to finish out current contracts. Default host settings use a \~26-week contract length and renters use a default \~3-month length, so you should switch new contracts off at least 6 months prior to when you'd like to shut down your host. Otherwise, you may still have contracts active which you could lose collateral for if you take your host offline before they complete.

Once you've switched off new contracts, you can track the progress of any current contracts by typing `host` into the Terminal `>` at the top of Sia-UI every week or so. Once all collateral is freed (no collateral shows as locked or risked), you can safely take your host offline. You can also use a tool like the [SiaStats Host Monitor](https://siastats.info/hosts) by searching for your host's IP address or domain name. While this service doesn't show contract details, once your host's used storage drops to zero all contracts should be completed.
