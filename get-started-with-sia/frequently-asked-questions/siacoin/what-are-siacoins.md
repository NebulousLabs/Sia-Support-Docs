# What is Siacoin?

Siacoin is the utility tokens that powers the Sia network. Everything you do on the network requires Siacoins, whether you want to rent, host, hold, or trade.

Although Siacoin can be used in lots of ways, it serves a single purpose â€“ to facilitate network operations. When you upload a file to Sia, you are paying for that storage in Siacoin. If you're a host and you're storing other people's data, you get paid in Siacoin. If you own Siafunds, your share of Sia network growth is paid out in, you guessed it, Siacoin.

Siacoin can be sent or received through your own wallet address. You can store them using the [official software wallet](../../../your-sia-wallet/wallet-setup/), a [hardware wallet](../../../your-sia-wallet/wallet-setup/for-advanced-users/using-the-sia-ledger-nano-s-app.md), or paper wallet. You can get Siacoin by [having someone send them](../../../your-sia-wallet/wallet-setup/how-to-make-a-sia-address.md) to you, [buying them on an exchange](how-to-buy-siacoins.md#buy-sc-from-an-exchange), or [mining them](broken-reference).

New Siacoin's are only made by mining. There's over 50 billion Siacoin's out there right now, and that number [will never stop growing](siacoin-total-supply.md). But if Sia is going to be the storage layer of the internet, then billions will be required to pay for the petabytes and exabytes of data that will be stored on Sia.
