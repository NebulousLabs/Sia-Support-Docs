# How can I contribute to Sia?

If you've got some dev skills and free time, Sia is here for you.

Sia is 100% open source and development is held on GitLab. The US and EU-based Nebulous team have been the core developers of Sia, but hundreds of individuals have contributed either to the core code or apps built on top of the network. Sia is now managed by the Sia Foundation.

We have a wonderful community, and we hope you'll find your place in it! Check the \#contributors channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/sia) to say hi, ask questions, or get opinions on your Sia-related code or app.
