# Tell me more about Siafunds.

Siafunds are tokens used for revenue sharing on the Sia network; a 3.9% fee from every storage-related transaction on Sia is distributed to the holders of Siafunds. The Sia core team currently holds approximately 85% of all Siafunds.

We created Siafunds in order to sustainably fund the development of the Sia network. Siafunds incentivize and enable us – and investors – to maintain and improve the Sia network by capturing a share of revenue as the network grows. As more users pay for storage, Siafund revenues increase, and more resources can be devoted toward Sia development.
