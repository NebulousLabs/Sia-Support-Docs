# I purchased Siafunds on an OTC channel or an exchange. What does this settlement mean for me?

The SEC has designated Siafunds as securities according to United States laws. If you purchased Siafunds on an OTC channel or a decentralized exchange, or are considering making a purchase, we recommend that you research the applicable securities laws in your country.

If you are based in the United States, you may be required to be an accredited investor to buy or sell Siafunds. We recommend consulting with an attorney.
