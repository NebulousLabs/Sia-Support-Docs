# How does the settlement impact the Sia network?

The Sia network is not impacted by the SEC settlement.

As reflected in the settlement, the SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the Siacoin token or any current activity on the Sia network, and the order does not require Nebulous to register the Siacoin token as a security with the SEC.

This means that after intense scrutiny and information gathering by the SEC, they decided to not modify, restrict, or suspend the Sia network in any way.
