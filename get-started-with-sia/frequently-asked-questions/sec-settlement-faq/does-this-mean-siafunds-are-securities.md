# Does this mean Siafunds are securities?

The SEC has designated Siafunds as securities according to United States laws. We expected this, and conducted our 2018 Siafunds offering in a legally-compliant manner via Regulation D. In this 2018 offering, we treated Siafunds as securities, and titled the offering “Tokenized Securities Offering” or “TSO.”

We recommend that you research the applicable securities laws in your country before buying or selling Siafunds.

If you are based in the United States, you may be required to be an accredited investor to buy or sell Siafunds. We recommend consulting with an attorney.
