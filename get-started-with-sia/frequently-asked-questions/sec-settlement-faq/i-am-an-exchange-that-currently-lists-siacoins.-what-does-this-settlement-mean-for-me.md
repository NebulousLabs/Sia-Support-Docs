# I am an exchange that currently lists Siacoins. What does this settlement mean for me?

Nothing! The SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the Siacoin token or any current activity on the Sia network, and the order does not require Nebulous to register the Siacoin token as a security with the SEC. The SEC was well informed of how Siacoins are created and used, including that they are traded on a number of exchanges around the world. We can provide any exchange a copy of a legal opinion regarding Siacoin's status as it relates to US securities law.
